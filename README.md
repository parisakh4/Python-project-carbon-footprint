# Carbon Emission Calculator

## Project Description

The Carbon Emission Calculator is a web application that allows users to calculate their carbon emissions based on energy usage, waste generation, and travel data. The application provides visual comparisons and generates a PDF report with recommendations for reducing carbon emissions.

## Features

- Calculate total carbon emissions based on user inputs.
- Compare emissions to benchmarks.
- Visualize emissions data with interactive charts.
- Generate and download a PDF report with emissions data and recommendations.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly
- **PDF Generation**: ReportLab
- **Temporary File Handling**: tempfile
- **UUID Generation**: uuid
- **Date and Time Handling**: datetime

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Enter your energy usage, waste generation, and travel data.
3. Click the "Total Emission Overview" button to calculate your total carbon emissions.
4. View the visual comparisons and recommendations.
5. Download the PDF report for your records.

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling to ensure a smooth user experience:
- **Input Validation**: Ensures all required fields are filled before performing calculations.
- **Try-Except Blocks**: Catches and handles exceptions that may occur during execution.
